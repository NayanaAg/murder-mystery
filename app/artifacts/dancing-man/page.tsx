                    <h1>The Dancing Man</h1>
                    <p>The spirit of the Dancing Man, originally known as Posledniy Bogatyr, is one of Eastern Europe's most violent and malevolent spectres. Although his original appearance and presence is documented in the traditional Russian style, the spirit has historically taken on many forms, appearing around the world as different cultural aspects of himself.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of the time period and location, the Dancing Man remains infamous for the trail of dead bodies he leaves in his wake. Traditional folklore claims that anyone who separates him from his tools of power or disturbs his slumber is <strong>marked for death within three days</strong>. Although skeptics may doubt these claims, the pattern is irrefutable; none have survived its wrath.</p>

                    <p>Part of what makes the Dancing Man impossible to avoid is his <strong>tendency to move around</strong>. As long as he is not tethered to one location with his sacred amulet, the spirit may vanish and reappear around the locale, waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike down its victims.</p>
